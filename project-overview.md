# Project Overview

Project Name: Flavor Forecast: Mock-tastic Food Adventures!

Description: A web application that *pretends* to be a personalized subscription service, using *imaginary* AI to predict your next favorite food combinations. Subscribers *won't* actually receive spice blends, but they *will* get weekly recipe ideas on a beautiful, interactive frontend, tailored to their *simulated* evolving palate. Prepare for a whirlwind of culinary *make-believe*!

Features:

*   **The "Crystal Ball" of Cuisine:** A fun quiz to determine your starting palate profile (e.g., "Adventurous Gourmet," "Comfort Foodie," "Spicy Explorer").
*   **Weekly Recipe "Predictions":** Display of curated recipe ideas matching the user's *fake* palate. Think vibrant photos and easy-to-follow (but not actually testable) instructions.
*   **Spice Blend "Recommendations":** Showcase of exotic spice blends that *might* tantalize your taste buds, if they were real.
*   **Subscription Management (The Illusion of Control):** A sleek interface to "manage" your subscription:
    *   "Pause" your subscription (nothing happens, but you feel in control!).
    *   "Update" your address (we'll store it...in the browser's memory!).
    *   "View" your order history (a list of *phantom* spice blends you never received!).
*   **"AI" Powered Flavor Wheel:** A visually appealing flavor wheel that spins and *randomly* selects flavor combinations, suggesting *hilariously* improbable pairings (e.g., "Strawberry & Sardine Surprise!").

Target Audience: Foodies with a sense of humor who appreciate a well-designed (but ultimately fake) experience.

Technology Stack:

*   Cloudflare next-on-pages framework (NextJS) for the web application.
